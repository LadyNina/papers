<h1 align=center>A Customization Point for domain-specific allocators</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
  This is a proposal for a new customization point for allocators; namely,
  it's a mechanism for adapting legacy allocators into uses-allocator
  construction, and allows external trait-adaptation of legacy allocators into
  the standard allocator model. Such adaptation allows even legacy
  allocators that are raw pointers to be used with uses-allocator construction;
  in such cases, there is no converting constructor on the target
  legacy allocator type that could be used, because legacy types traffick
  in allocator pointers. The customization point provides a mechanism
  for converting a standard allocator into the right kind of target
  type, including raw pointers.
</p>
<p>
  Such a mechanism is thus a significant migration help for
  existing code that uses legacy 3rd party allocators, for migrating
  such code to use standard allocators and standard-allocator-aware
  types. We can use e.g. pmr::vector with such legacy types and legacy
  allocators with minimal modifications.
</p>

<h2>tl;dr</h2>

<p>
  First, we define a primary template for the customization point:
</p>

<pre><blockquote><code>template &lt;class _Tp, class _Alloc&gt;
  struct __domain_allocator_traits {
    static constexpr bool value = false;
  };
</code></blockquote></pre>

<p>A specialization looks roughly like the following:
</p>

<pre><blockquote><code>namespace std {
template&lt;&gt;
struct __domain_allocator_traits&lt;my_value_type, std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator&lt;&gt;&gt; {
    static constexpr bool value = true;
    static my_alloc* rebind(std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator&lt;&gt; _a);
};
}</code></blockquote></pre>


<p>And a real-life specialization looks like the following:
</p>

<pre><blockquote><code>namespace std {
  template &lt;class TYPE&gt;
    struct __domain_allocator_traits&lt;TYPE, typename bsl::enable_if&lt;
      BloombergLP::bslma::UsesBslmaAllocator&lt;TYPE&gt;::value,
    std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator&lt;&gt;&gt;::type>
: BloombergLP::bslma::UsesBslmaAllocator&lt;TYPE&gt;::type
{
  static BloombergLP::bslma::Allocator* rebind(std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator&lt;&gt; a)
    {
      return dynamic_cast&lt;BloombergLP::bslma::Allocator*&gt;(a.resource());
    }
}</code></blockquote></pre>

<p>
  Finally, we modify uses-allocator construction so that
  it detects the presence of __domain_allocator_traits&lt;T, Alloc&gt;::rebind
  and calls it if it's present, and uses the result as an allocator.
</p>								   

<h2>An alternative way</h2>

<p>
  In early stages of prototyping of this proposal, we used
  a simpler downcast operator added to polymorphic_allocator.
  It looks like this:
</p>

<pre><blockquote><code>template &lt;typename _Target,
  typename =
  enable_if_t&lt;
    __is_dynamic_castable&lt;_Target*, memory_resource*&gt;::value
     &amp;&amp; !is_same_v&lt;_Target, memory_resource&gt;&gt;&gt;
  operator _Target*() const
    {
      memory_resource* res = resource();
      _Target&amp; ret = dynamic_cast&lt;_Target&apm;&gt;(*res);
      return &amp;ret;
    }
</code></blockquote></pre>

<p>
  This was deemed too fishy (because it's an implicit downcasting
  conversion) by some early reviewers. It is, however,
  a much simpler solution than a new customization point. In this
  alternative approach, uses-allocator construction is not modified,
  and all that is needed for legacy types is uses_allocator specializations,
  and with the nifty trick we showed above for __domain_allocator_traits,
  there needs to be only one (in that case for plain uses_allocator),
  even though there's dozens of legacy types that need adaptation.
  There is also no need for a new customization point in this alternative
  approach.
</p>

<h2>About the customization points, request for feedback/decision</h2>

<p>
  We have implemented two approaches:
  <ul>
    <li>one where uses_allocator is unmodified</li>
    <li>another wehere uses_allocator depends on __domain_allocator_traits</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Keeping the customization points separate is sort of kind of nice; it limits
  the impact of this extension somewhat. But we need to modify uses_allocator
  construction anyway, so the impact isn't zero. We can squint at
  the design in a way that suggests that advertising uses_allocator
  is a bit fishy if the type/allocator combination doesn't actually
  support exactly that allocator, but keep in mind that in this
  design, uses-allocator construction supports it anyway. So from
  that perspective, perhaps it's not so fishy.
</p>
<p>
  Where this matters is that a type that makes some sort of a decision
  based on whether a template parameter supports allocators may need
  to use two traits instead of one to make that decision. Our separately
  proposed pmr::optional is such a type. With the first approach,
  it needs to use both uses_allocator and __domain_allocator_traits
  to decide whether to enable allocator support for the parametered
  type. In the second approach, it needs only uses_allocator. Types
  like pmr::vector don't care, but types that change their internal
  storage and API based on this decision do care.
</p>
<p>
  LEWG should decide whether uses_allocator should depend on
  __domain_allocator_traits.
